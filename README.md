To determine whether there is a relationship between bill length and bill depth, we will first consider a linear regression model: bill depth = beta_0 + beta_1 * bill length +
beta_2 * sex + beta_3 * species

 

After fitting the model, we would have to verify that the residuals have the same variance along different observations. Also,  we have to verify the independence of errors.
